GENERAL NOTES ON INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instruction to install the python packages needed by PAOFLOW and to run the code:

Python + MPI:

wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
conda install mpi4py
conda install pip
pip install multiprocessing

Intel Distribution for python:

I was able to gain at least an order of magnitude in performance boost by installing
the Intel distribution for python on my local DELL PowerEdge T630: 
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-distribution-for-python-with-anaconda
The same installation does not seem to improve the performance of python on Stampede (UTexas)
or Talon2 (UNT).

Save and Restart:

PAOFLOW can save data and restart from data at selected checkpoints. However, it uses the numpy.savez 
protocol, which needs a TMP directory to store intermediate arrays. To make it work, define a TMP 
directory (export TMPDIR=local_dir) with enough space (typically you need to have at least 2 x dimension 
of the largest array as written in the output).
