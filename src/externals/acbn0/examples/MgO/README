Quantum ESPRESSO must be compiled with the updated files set_hubbard_l.f90, set_hubbard_n.f90, and tabd.f90. 
These files are located in the src/externals/acbn0/QE_mods directory.

To use ACBN0, three QE inputfiles must exist:
prefix.scf.in
prefix.nscf.in
prefix.projwfc.in

To start the acbn0 calculations, modify scfuj.py accordingly(eg. QE_path PAO_path), then run:
python scfuj.py prefix

To run this example, MgO:
python scfuj.py MgO
